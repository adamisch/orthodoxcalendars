# Orthodox Calendars

The data in [Bible data](https://github.com/adamisch/orthodoxcalendars/tree/main/bible_data) is used under a [Creative Commons 1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) license since it's in the public domain in the US, but I thank [Oswin Rahadiyan Hartono on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/oswinrh/bible) for compiling it.

Orthodox Christian churches prescribe daily Bible readings. There are many different Orthodox Christian jurisdictions with the same beliefs and different local customs--including, famously, different calendars. Not all Orthodox jurisdictions use the Julian calendar (or they don't use it all the time), but they sometimes prescribe slightly different readings for each day. 

I personally find it unnecessarily cumbersome to manually look up the readings every day. Though there are many apps available for this purpose, I dislike reading on screens. So I scraped the data myself and [sell Orthodox digital calendars on Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/orthodoxcalendars). I printed mine out (as have some of my buyers) so I can read the readings on paper for every day of 2021.

(Assembling the calendar is a lot more work than just the scraping, as it involves formatting, noting holidays, etc.)
